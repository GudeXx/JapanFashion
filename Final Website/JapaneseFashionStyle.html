            <span class=title1>Influence of the West to Japanese Fashion</span>
            <br><br>
            At the the beginning of the Meiji Era (1868-1912), the traditional Japanese attire has become more absorbed in its culture. 
            However, Western culture caught Japan’s curiosity, and it gain more visual evidence on its influence. 
            Specifically, the United States has created a strong influence on Japanese fashion.
            <br><br>
            The media exposure of American fashion designers and their styles has initially influenced the Japanese buyers.
            Then, local designers started to follow and infuse their creations with the latest western trends.
            By the beginning of the Shōwa period (1926-1989), men and women’s fashion styles had become largely ‘westernised’.</p>

            <span class=title1>Japonisme</span>
            <br><br>
            Now as an influencer, Japanese Fashion has mostly infleunced the French culture. The influence is entitled as 'Japonisme'.
            ‘Japonism’ signifies a wide range of Japanese aesthetics, innovative techniques, themes and nature-based motifs, nowadays used by western designers.
            <br><br>
            While the effects of the trend were likely most pronounced in the visual arts, they extended to architecture, landscaping and gardening, and clothing.
            Even the performing arts were affected; Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado is perhaps the best example.
